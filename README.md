overview of LED BLINKING WITH ARDUINO
Objective:  
The objective of this project is to demonstrate basic embedded programming concepts using an Arduino, specifically to blink an LED at a specified interval. It introduces the fundamentals of controlling hardware through software and provides an understanding of how microcontrollers interact with external components.

Key Elements:  
The key elements of the project include the Arduino microcontroller, an LED connected to a digital pin, and basic programming techniques such as configuring input/output pins, using the `digitalWrite()` function to control the LED, and the `delay()` function to manage time intervals.

Technology Used:  
The technology used in this project involves embedded systems programming with the Arduino platform. The Arduino IDE is utilized for writing and uploading the code to the microcontroller, using C/C++ syntax to interact with hardware components. This project provides hands-on experience with microcontroller programming and hardware interfacing.
